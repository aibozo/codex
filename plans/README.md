# Plans Directory

This folder stores planning and roadmap documents used to coordinate the incremental
development of Codex CLI.  All files should be committed to version control so they
can be reviewed and discussed like any other change to the code-base.

File-naming convention

• `YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md` for Markdown documents
• `YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.yaml` for machine-consumable plans or task graphs

Keeping the deterministic path stable ensures that Git diffs stay readable and that
automation can locate files without additional configuration.
